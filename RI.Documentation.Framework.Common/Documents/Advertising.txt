Modularization:

Composition:

Collections:

Utilities:

Desktop and Mobile: Works on desktop and mobile. Tested with Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS.

Well documented: All classes, methods, properties, etc. are documented. Concepts are explained and demonstrated using simple code snippets.

For everyone: Editor centric? Utilities and collections make scripting easier! Code centric? Improve structure and maintainability using Modularization and Composition!

Non-intrusive: Functionalities are independent of each other (except Modularization) so you only deal with what you need.
